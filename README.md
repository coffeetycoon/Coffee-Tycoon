#### Bug Fixes
- Remove the number of achievements from achievement packs ([number unlocked]/[number total] achievements will not show anymore), while keeping the green progress bar
  - Same for upgrade packs
- Reduce the size of red dot on tabs for notifications, so the dot doesn't overlay onto text
- Upgrade purchase notifications don't look the same as shop item purchase notifications, so now upgrade purchase will look like shop item purchase notifications

- Achievement claim notification will be restyled to look like the shop purchase notification
